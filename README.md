# Sensitivity-Based Attack for Strip-Locked Circuits

This repo contains an example of the sensitivity-based attack as well as a script to characterize sensitivity.



To run the sensitivty characterization:
```
make sensitivities.p
```
To run the attack:
```
make break/ttlock_<circuit>_<key_width>.key
```
